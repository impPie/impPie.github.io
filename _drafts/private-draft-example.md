This is a draft post that won't be published to the live site.
You can work on it here and move it to `_posts` when ready to publish.

## Benefits of using _drafts:
- Not visible on the live site
- Can be previewed locally with `jekyll serve --drafts`
- Easy to move to `_posts` when ready to publish
