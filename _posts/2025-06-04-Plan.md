# you plan, God laughs.

Goal: Deepen your existing financial literacy, understand market mechanics, and explore different investment vehicles beyond the basics.

Time Commitment: Utilize your 1 hr/weekday, 2 hr/weekend.

## Step 1: Deep Dive into Investment Theory & Asset Classes (Weeks 1-8)

Action:
Advanced Stock Analysis: Go beyond "understanding stocks." Learn about:
Fundamental Analysis: Reading financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement), understanding key ratios (P/E, P/B, EPS, ROE), competitive advantages (moats), industry analysis, and macroeconomic factors.
Technical Analysis: Chart patterns, indicators (MACD, RSI, Moving Averages), support/resistance levels, volume analysis. Understand its uses and limitations.
ETFs & Mutual Funds In-Depth: Types of ETFs (sector, thematic, leveraged, inverse), expense ratios, tracking error. Active vs. Passive mutual funds.
Bonds: Different types of bonds (government, corporate), credit ratings, interest rate risk, duration.
Real Estate (REITs): Learn about Real Estate Investment Trusts as an accessible way to invest in real estate.
Other Asset Classes (Optional for now, but good to know): Briefly explore commodities, derivatives (options, futures – be very cautious here), and cryptocurrencies. Understand their risk profiles.

## Step 2: Understanding Market Psychology & Behavioral Finance (Weeks 9-12)

Action: Learn about common investor biases (herd mentality, confirmation bias, loss aversion) and how they can impact decision-making. This is crucial for managing your emotions, especially with a high-risk strategy.
Resources:
Books: "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman, "Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics" by Richard Thaler.

## Step 4: Define Your Initial High-Risk Strategy (Weeks 13-16)

Action: Based on your learning, what kind of high-risk, hands-on approach appeals to you?
Growth Investing: Focusing on companies expected to grow at an above-average rate.
Momentum Trading: Buying assets that have shown an upward price trend.
Swing Trading: Holding positions for a few days or weeks to profit from price swings.
Sector/Thematic Investing: Concentrating on specific industries or trends you believe will outperform.
Develop a basic trading plan: Define entry/exit criteria, risk management rules (e.g., position sizing, stop-loss orders – critical for high-risk strategies).

## step 6: Phased Capital Deployment (Month 7 onwards)

Action:
Start by investing a small portion of your designated high-risk capital (e.g., 10-20% of your ¥1M).
Gradually increase the amount as you gain confidence and see consistent (even if small) positive results from your paper trading and initial real trades.
$Simultaneously, start building a core, lower-risk portfolio$ with a portion of your monthly savings using your NISA/iDeCo accounts – perhaps focusing on broad market index ETFs. This provides some diversification even as you pursue high-risk strategies with a separate pot of money. This becomes increasingly important as you get closer to FIRE.

Journal every trade: Why did you enter? What was your target? What was your stop-loss? What was the outcome? What did you learn?
Stay updated on market news, economic data, and company-specific news.
Review your performance weekly and monthly. Are you sticking to your plan? Are your strategies working?
Position Sizing: Never risk more than 1-2% of your trading capital on a single trade.
Tax Implications (Japan): Ensure you understand the tax rules for investments in Japan (capital gains tax, dividend tax) and utilize tax-advantaged accounts like NISA and iDeCo to their full potential. Seek advice from a local tax professional if needed.
Currency Risk: If investing in non-JPY assets, be aware of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
