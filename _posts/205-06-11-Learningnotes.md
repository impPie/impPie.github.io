## stop order
momentum chasing
Sell Stop (Stop-Loss): You own a stock, and you want to sell it if the price falls to a certain level to prevent further losses.
Example: Stock is at $100. You place a Sell Stop Order at $90. This order does nothing as long as the price is above $90. It's an inactive instruction sitting on your broker's server. Only if the price drops to $90 does it trigger the order to sell.
