The Planning System: A Step-by-Step Guide

Phase 1: Foundation & Goal Setting

Step 1: Define Your "North Star" – Your Ultimate Learning Vision.

Action: Ask yourself: "What do I specifically want to be able to do or understand by the end of this learning journey (or a significant phase of it)?" Be as concrete as possible.
Example (Trading): Instead of "learn trading," it could be "I want to be able to independently identify, execute, and manage swing trades based on technical analysis in a simulated environment with a consistent application of my defined strategy rules."
Why: A clear vision keeps you motivated and helps you filter out irrelevant information.
Step 2: Honest Self-Assessment & Resource Inventory.

Action (Self-Assessment): What do you already know related to this goal? What are your current strengths (e.g., analytical, disciplined) and weaknesses (e.g., easily distracted, impatient) regarding learning?
Action (Resource Inventory): List the resources you currently have:
Time: (You've defined this: 1hr weekdays, 2hr weekends = 9hrs/week).
Materials: Any books, courses, websites you already know of or have access to?
Tools: Access to charting software (even free versions), internet, quiet space?
Why: Understanding your starting point and available tools helps make the plan realistic.
Phase 2: Structuring Your Learning

Step 3: Deconstruct Your "North Star" into Major Learning Modules.

Action: Break down your ultimate goal into 3-5 high-level topics or skill areas you need to master. Think of these as the main chapters of your learning.
Example (Swing Trading):
Market Fundamentals & Terminology
Deep Dive into Technical Analysis (Charts, Indicators, Patterns)
Strategy Development & Risk Management Principles
Trading Psychology & Emotional Discipline
Platform Proficiency & Simulated Trading Practice
Why: Prevents overwhelm by breaking a large goal into manageable chunks.
Step 4: Prioritize and Sequence These Modules.

Action: Arrange the modules in a logical learning order. What needs to come first? What builds upon previous knowledge?
Example: Market Fundamentals usually precedes Deep Dive into Technical Analysis.
Why: Ensures you build a solid foundation before moving to more complex topics.
Phase 3: Detailed Planning & Scheduling

Step 5: For Each Module, Define Specific Learning Objectives & Activities.

Action (Objectives): For each module, list 3-5 specific things you want to know or be able to do upon completion. Use action verbs: "Identify...", "Explain...", "Calculate...", "Apply...".
Example (Module: Technical Analysis): "Objective 1: Identify the 5 most common candlestick reversal patterns on a daily chart."
Action (Activities): For each objective, list the specific actions you will take to achieve it.
Example (Objective 1 above): "Activity 1.1: Read Chapter 3 of Steve Nison's book on candlestick patterns. Activity 1.2: Watch 3 specific YouTube videos on identifying these patterns. Activity 1.3: Practice finding these patterns on 20 historical charts using TradingView."
Why: This is where your plan becomes truly actionable. It tells you what to do.
Step 6: Allocate Time & Create a Realistic Schedule.

Action: Estimate how many of your 1-hour or 2-hour sessions each activity/objective might take. Distribute your modules, objectives, and activities across a timeline (e.g., over several weeks or months).
Daily/Weekly Breakdown: Plan your upcoming week every Sunday. Decide which specific activities you'll tackle in your daily 1-hour slots and your 2-hour weekend slots. Be specific for each day.
Example (Weekday - 1hr): "Monday: Complete Activity 1.1 (Read Nison Ch.3, focus on first 2 patterns)."
Why: This translates your plan into a daily/weekly operational guide that respects your time constraints.
Step 7: Identify & Assign Specific Learning Resources.

Action: For each planned activity, explicitly name the resource you will use (e.g., "Murphy's 'Technical Analysis', Chapter 5," "BabyPips - School of Pipsology, Grade 3," "YouTube channel 'XYZ', specific playlist on indicators").
Why: Removes ambiguity and saves time when you sit down to learn. You won't waste precious minutes figuring out what to use.
Phase 4: Execution & Adaptation

Step 8: Integrate Active Learning & Practice Mechanisms.

Action: For each module/objective, think about how you will actively engage with the material beyond just reading or watching.
Summarize concepts in your own words.
Take handwritten notes.
Create mind maps.
Try to "teach" the concept to someone else (even an imaginary student).
Schedule dedicated practice: chart drills, backtesting exercises, paper trading sessions.
Why: Active learning significantly improves retention and understanding compared to passive consumption.
Step 9: Schedule Regular Review & Adaptation Points.

Action: At the end of each week (e.g., during your Sunday planning session), review:
What did you accomplish according to your plan?
What went well? What challenges did you face (distractions, difficult concepts)?
Does any part of your plan need adjustment for next week or the coming month? (Is the pacing right? Are the resources effective? Do you need to spend more time on a certain topic?)
Why: A plan is a living document. Regular reviews keep it relevant and effective. It allows you to be agile.
Step 10: Implement Progress Tracking & Maintain Motivation.

Action (Tracking): Use a simple checklist, a spreadsheet, or a dedicated app (like Trello or Asana, even their free versions) to mark off completed activities, objectives, and modules.
Action (Motivation):
Remind yourself of your "North Star."
Acknowledge and celebrate small wins (e.g., "I finally understand RSI divergence!").
If you fall off track, don't dwell on it. Just pick up where you left off with the next scheduled session.
Why: Seeing progress is motivating. Understanding how to stay motivated is crucial for long-term learning.
Tips for Making This System Work for You:

Start Broad, Then Get Granular: Begin with the big picture (North Star, Modules) and progressively drill down to daily tasks.
Be Realistic, Not Overambitious: Especially with limited time and distractions, it's better to plan less and achieve it consistently than to over-plan and feel constantly behind.
Iterate – Your First Plan is a Draft: The first version of your plan won't be perfect. The act of planning and then reviewing and adapting is where the real learning happens.
Focus on Process, Not Just Outcome (Initially): Especially in the early stages, focus on consistently executing your learning process (e.g., showing up for your scheduled hour, engaging actively). Understanding will build over time.
Batch Similar Tasks: If you're researching resources, do it for a whole module at once. If you're doing chart drills, dedicate a full session to it.
Prepare Your Environment: Before each session, minimize distractions (phone away, clear desk, quiet if possible).
